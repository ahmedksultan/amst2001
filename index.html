                    <p>We've created an interactive website that displays
                        all the buildings owned and operated by Cornell University, 
                        with a focus on providing historical information for a smaller set of buildings that we found especially interesting or important. 
                        
                        <br><br>
                        The website uses an API called Mapbox, which allows for mapping of location data to specific buildings with an interactive user interface. Although other websites (such as the facilities map of all Cornell buildings) provide a similar overlay of buildings, our focus on including historical data is novel. Most of our images are sourced from the Wikimedia Commons and the University Library Archive.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        We hope that the website will allow those interested to learn more about the history of Cornell's campus in a fun and interactive way! <i>Click on any of the map markers to get more information.</i>

Bailey Hall is an auditorium building and is the largest auditorium on campus. Significant changes were made to the building during a refurbishment and renovation process finished in 2006. Although seating capacity decreased from 1,948 to 1,324 following the renovation, several features of the building were significantly improved. For example, softer and more accommodating seating was introduced, contrasting sharply with the hard wooden seats that were previously installed. A handicapped-accessible elevator also improved the building from an accessibility perspective. The building is a state building, with both the university and New York State contributing to the renovation, which were designed by Mitchell/Giurgola Architects."

It also served as the University's first student union. Alfred S. Barnes, a Cornell University trustee and publisher, funded the construction of the building. The construction of the building was associated with a string of deaths. Barnes, the superintending architect, the senior contracter, the stone carver and the gas fixture contractor all died following the approval process and during construction.

The building's state affiliations come from Cornell's requirement to offer military instruction as a state land-grant university. The original 'drill-shed' accommodated 1,000 people with an area of 362x228 feet. Barton Hall is named after Colonel Frank A. Barton '91, one of the first students to be the recipient of an army commission from Cornell's Military Science Program. Today, it houses the Cornell Police, an Indoor Track and ROTC offices."

Although Cornell's sponsorship of a hockey team began in 1900, all home games were played on Beebe Lake. A series of warmer winters caused this to be unfeasible, so the program was put on hold and restarted when Lynah Rink opened. The inaugural game at the rink was between the NY Rangers and the Rochester Americans on March 21, 1957. A renovation of the building occurred in 2000 and an extension was built in 2006. Lynah Rink has a capacity of 4,267 people and is well known for the 'Lynah Faithful', the Cornell fans who ardently support their team (which is everyone at the University) -- often in flamboyant fashion!"

Wilcox and Cyrus K. Porter, both from Buffalo. It was Cornell's first newly constructed building and was named after Senator Justin Morrill of Vermont, the senator behind the Land Grant Act of 1862, which gave significant resources to the University in its early years (with significant controversy, as these lands came largely from territories of American Indigenous peoples). The National Park Service description of the building says that the building 'looks as if it will endure for all time', a sentiment we wholeheartedly agree with! The building currently houses the Departments of Romance Studies, Russian Literature, and Linguistics. Morrill Hall was initially named South University Building and was intended to face the slope west of the Arts Quad (what is now known as Libe Slope or Library Slope). This is also true of the other two buildings, White and McGraw Halls, which together form the historic 'Old Stone Row'. The gray stone used in the buildings was quarried locally."

In 1883, the Memorial Antechapel was added in the northwest corner of the building in memory of Ezra Cornell, John McGraw, and Jennie McGraw Fiske. Several additional expansions occurred: in 1898 with the Sage Memorial Apse for the bodies of Henry W. Sage and Susan Linn Sage and in 1904 with the north transept to house the organ and choir. The Chapel also features significant Christian and educational design motifs, on the walls, windows and roofs."
